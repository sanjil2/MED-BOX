# MED-BOX

What is a MED-BOX?
The MED-BOX is an automatic medicine vending machine, that has the capability to receive input from the user and then dispense the required dose and quantity of medicine. The input, here means, the prescription by the physician to the user. The system features a machine that is capable of handling a complete range of prescriptions.
It gives the availability of medicines all the time, also in rural areas. It is very helpful; it gives ease of access also. It is a sales person-less service that is based on a smart card. MED-BOX can be viewed as an automated pharmacy placed on a commercial scale so that an infinite number of users will be able to access it anytime.
MED-BOX will cater to the needs of the customers with no further human intervention required. The machine is user-friendly and is very simple to operate. With this, labor costs will be minimized and it will also give entrepreneurs the opportunity to attract more customers with this innovation.
The design is based on simplicity and the utilization of low-cost materials and components that can be easily available.
MEDBOX aimed at closing this gap by collating quality, open-access, practical documents such as clinical guidelines, assessment checklists or textbooks on one homepage. The MEDBOX team started to better apply what we know already by allowing easy access to what is available. In addition, MEDBOX started developing innovative generic checklists and survey tools for humanitarian practitioners for all aspects of work.
